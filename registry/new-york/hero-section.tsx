/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * akta-hero-01 — "technical drawing on white paper"
 *
 * Every value lives in this file, and the akta- CSS it shares with the other
 * akta sections comes from ./akta-css (rendered as a <style> inside the
 * section): nothing is written into globals.css. That CSS covers what a utility cannot express: the notch's
 * masked pseudo-element, the hatch gradient, the rolling label's three
 * coordinated elements, the tick field's indexed stagger, the plate, and the
 * entrance keyframes.
 *
 * There is no `@theme` block and no `:root` palette, so nothing here can
 * collide with — or be re-skinned by — the host's stylesheet, and no class can
 * silently do nothing because a token was never installed. The trade is that
 * dark mode is carried by a `dark:` twin on every colour rather than by
 * swapping one variable, which is why the tokens below are grouped constants
 * rather than repeated at each call site.
 *
 * Every className is assembled with `cn()` in a fixed order so a given concern
 * is always in the same argument:
 *
 *     cn( layout , type , colour , state , device )
 *
 * Read design.md (shipped alongside) before building a matching section.

                so it frames the panel rather than hiding behind it. No scrim:
                the panel and both cards are opaque, so the texture only ever
                shows in the margin.

                It bleeds to the full width of the 1440 grid: stage, grid and
                viewport share a centre line, so `left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2`
                plus `w-screen` lands it on the rails at every width. It clips
                inside its own wrapper rather than on the stage, because the
                cards and the panel's brackets sit outside the stage box.

                The bottom bleed stays at 40px while the top grows to 64px. It
                is deliberately asymmetric: above the stage is more of the same
                section, but below it is the logo wall, and the plate must stop
                inside the hero's bottom padding. Bleed past that and the
                photograph lands on the wall's top rule — an 8%-black hairline,
                invisible against a dark image — so the wall reads as having no
                separator at all. */}
