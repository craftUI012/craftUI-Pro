 * Same contract as akta-hero-01: every value lives in this file as a Tailwind
 * arbitrary value with its dark twin, and the akta- CSS it shares with the
 * hero (the notch device class and the scroll-reveal keyframe) comes from
 * ./akta-css, rendered as a <style> inside the section. Nothing is written
 * into globals.css. There is no `@theme` block and no `:root` palette.
 *
 * The SVG charts follow the same rule. Fills and strokes are `fill-[…]` /
 * `stroke-[…]` utilities on the SVG elements rather than inline `var()`s, so
 * the charts flip with `.dark` like everything else and never depend on a
 * token that was not installed.
 *
 * Every className is assembled with `cn()` in a fixed order:
 *
 *     cn( layout , type , colour , state , device )

/* ── Form 1 · isometric bar city ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 2:1 dimetric rather than true 30° isometric: the shallower angle costs half
 * the vertical drop across six bars, which is the difference between fitting a
 * 1/4-width cell and not.
 *
 *   project(x, y, z) = [x - y, (x + y) / 2 - z]
 *
 * 3D is a poor instrument for comparing close values — foreshortening and the
 * top face both read as extra length — so it is spent on F1 and only F1, where
 * the winning margin is 30% and precision is not what the cell is for.
 *
 * Labels are the whole difficulty here: in isometric, the space below-right of
 * every bar is occupied by the next bar, so nothing can sit under a bar. They
 * drop instead on vertical leaders to a lane below the ground line, rotated
 * -90°. A leader at the front vertex of bar i has x = i * PITCH, and bar i+1
 * starts at i * PITCH + 12, so no leader ever crosses a solid.
 *
 * PITCH must clear BW + BD (48) or adjacent bars overlap in projection: a bar
 * spans ±BW from its own centre while centres sit PITCH apart. 50 leaves a

 * rule between them, no boxes. Title first because the four headers then line up across the band —
 * under charts of different heights they never did — and because "higher is
 * better" only means something once you know what it is higher *of*. The
